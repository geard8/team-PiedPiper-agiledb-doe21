Introduction
This single-file repository consists of a README file in Markdown format, and is meant to provide a template for README files as well an illustration of what the README file can be expected to look like. The structure of this file is based on examining many examples and recommendations for README files, as well as this author's own experiences of creating many open-source projects and repositories over three decades.

Introduction– 
A medium-sized company has contacted Chas Academy because they decided to build a crossroads between the 90's Community and a specialized e-commerce for pets to take up the fight with Amazon. In addition to the usual functionality that most e-commerce platforms have, they also want to enable networking between users, with groups and messages.
Installation
Begin this section by mentioning any prerequisites that may be important for users to have before they can use your software. Examples include hardware and operating system requirements.

Next, provide step-by-step instructions for installing the software, preferably with command examples that can be copy-pasted by readers into their software environments. For example:

a command-line command here
Sometimes, subsections may be needed for different operating systems or particularly complicated installations.

Usage
This section explains the principles behind this README file. If this repository were for actual software, this Usage section would explain more about how to run the software, what kind of output or behavior to expect, and so on.

Basic operation
A suggested approach for using this example README file is as follows:

Copy the source file for this file to your repository and commit it to your version control system
Delete all the body text but keep the section headings
Write your README content
Commit the new text to your version control system
Update your README file as your software evolves
The first paragraph in the README file (under the title at the very top) should summarize your software in a concise fashion, preferably using no more than one or two sentences.



The space under the first paragraph and before the Table of Contents is a good location for optional badges, which are small visual tokens commonly used on GitHub repositories to communicate project status, dependencies, versions, DOIs, and other information. The particular badges and colors you use depend on your project and personal tastes.

The Introduction and Usage sections are described above.

In the Known issues and limitations section, summarize any notable issues and/or limitations of your software. The Getting help section should inform readers of how they can contact you, or at least, how they can report problems they may encounter. The Contributing section is optional; if your repository is for a project that accepts open-source contributions, then this section is where you can explain to readers how they can go about making contributions.

The License section should state any copyright asserted on the project materials as well as the terms of use of the software, files and other materials found in the project repository. Finally, the Authors and history section should inform readers who the authors are; it is also a place where you can acknowledge other contributions to the work and the use of other people's software or tools.

Additional options
Some projects need to communicate additional information to users and can benefit from additional sections in the README file. It's difficult to give specific instructions – a lot depends on your software, your intended audience, etc. Use your judgment and ask for feedback from users or colleagues to help figure out what else is worth explaining.

Known issues and limitations
In this section, summarize any notable issues and/or limitations of your software. If none are known yet, this section can be omitted (and don't forget to remove the corresponding entry in the Table of Contents too); alternatively, you can leave this section in and write something along the lines of "none are known at this time".

Getting help
Inform readers of how they can contact you, or at least how they can report problems they may encounter. This may simply be a request to use the issue tracker on your repository, but many projects have associated chat or mailing lists, and this section is a good place to mention those.

Contributing
Mention how people can offer contributions, and point them to your guidelines for contributing.
