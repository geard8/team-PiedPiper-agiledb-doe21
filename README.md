This repo is for documentation of assignment u04a-sql-scrum.  
  
The goal of this assignment is to design and implement a SQL database in Postgres.  
In the design phase we've created a logical model and a physical model to visualise entities, attributes, relationships and constraints.  
To implement the SQL schema we've used psql (CLI) and pgadmin (GUI).  
A big part of this assignment was to learn, understand and use scrum to manage workflows.  

## Purpose  

The database is going to be used by an app which has two main functions - a forum where users can connect to others directly via private messaging or through user-generated groups. The other part of the app is a webbshop where users can buy products.

## Agile methods  

A big part of this assignment was to get to know and use Scrum as a method for Agile development. 


### Scrum  

We've been working with scrum during this assignment and dividing it up with sprints. Also we have had a new scrum master for each week. 

### Workflow  

We used Trello for managing our scrum board.

## SQL modelling  

For our logical and physical models we talked with in our group and decided what to have in the database. We documented alot during this assignment and wrote it all down. We used both whimsical and PGadmin to create these models.
