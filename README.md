This repo is for documentation of assignment u04a-sql-scrum.  
  
The goal of this assignment is to design and implement a SQL database in Postgres.  
In the design phase we've created a logical model and a physical model to visualise entities, attributes, relationships and constraints.  
To implement the SQL schema we've used psql (CLI) and pgadmin (GUI).  
A big part of this assignment was to learn, understand and use agile metod to manage workflows.  

## Purpose  

The database is going to be used by an app which has two main functions - a socal media part where users can connect to others directly via private messaging or through user-generated groups or post that all can read. The other part of the app is a webbshop where users can buy products.

## Agile methods  

A big part of this assignment was to get to know and use Scrum as a method for Agile development. We have used scrum and kanban board. 

As part of scrum we have hade daily meeting most days, where every one talk about what they prevusly done, what they plan to do and any hindrens or problem that they may have. 

We have had sprint planning meetings decide that we plan do during the next sprint. 

We have had retorepektiv meeting where we check what been good and bad, as well as document importent obsevertion and changes we wish to try out.

We have had review meeting to check that thinks that is been has been done in a way the group think is good.

### Workflow  

We used Trello for managing our kanban board.

## SQL modelling  

For our logical and physical models we talked with in our group and decided what to have in the database. We documented alot during this assignment and wrote it all down. We have also checked with PO about servral thinks to make it avoid missunderstings and make it more clear that needed. We used both writings in docuemnt, whimsical and PGadmin to create these models.
